Interpretation Definitions 2 The following definitions apply in this Act. law of Canada includes (a) an Act of Parliament or a regulation, rule, order, by-law or ordinance made under an Act of Parliament; and (b) an order or decision of a court of Canada. ( loi f\u00e9d\u00e9rale ) Taiwan includes, as the context may require, the islands of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, the people on those islands, any corporations and other entities and associations created or organized under the laws of those islands, the governing authorities of Taiwan recognized by Canada as the Republic of China before October 13, 1970, and any successor governing authorities, including any political subdivision, agency or instrumentality. ( Taiwan ) Policy of Government of Canada Declaration of policy 3 (1) It is the policy of the Government of Canada to (a) preserve and promote close relations between the people of Canada and the people of Taiwan, including in respect of economic, cultural and legal affairs; (b) conduct its foreign relations on the basis that peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region are in the political, security and economic interests of Canada, and are matters of international concern; (c) consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, or by boycotts or embargoes, to be a threat to the peace and security of the Indo-Pacific region and of grave concern to Canada; and (d) support the peaceful evolution of democratic political institutions in the Indo-Pacific region. International cooperation (2) For the purposes of furthering international cooperation, it is also the policy of the Government of Canada to (a) support the participation of Taiwan in multilateral international organizations, including the World Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation Organization, and encourage other states and non-governmental organizations to support this goal so that Taiwan may play a role that is commensurate with its position in the Indo-Pacific region; (b) exempt the president or senior government officials of Taiwan from the requirement to obtain the visa required under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act when the primary purpose of their visit to Canada is not official; and (c) permit the office of the representative of the Government of Taiwan in Canada to be referred to as the Taiwan Representative Office. References, Property, Legal Capacity and Agreements References to foreign states 4 A general reference in a law of Canada to foreign states or to their governments, including any institutions or agencies of those governments, is deemed to include Taiwan. Property ownership protected 5 For all purposes under the laws of Canada, including an action in any court in Canada, formal recognition of the People\u2019s Republic of China does not affect the ownership of, or other rights or interests in, any real, personal, movable or immovable property, including intellectual property and any other thing of value, owned or held on or before October 13, 1970, or acquired or earned after that date by Taiwan or a citizen of Taiwan. Capacity to sue and be sued 6 (1) Taiwan has the capacity to sue and be sued in a court in Canada in accordance with the laws of Canada, in particular the laws respecting the status of states, relations between states and immunity entitlements granted to states. Capacity not affected (2) In an action in any court in Canada, the capacity referred to in subsection (1) is not abrogated, infringed, modified, denied or otherwise affected in any way by the absence of diplomatic relations with or formal recognition of Taiwan, or by the absence of any certificate that may usually be issued by the Government of Canada for the purposes of litigation. Intergovernmental agreements 7 It is acknowledged that, even in the absence of official diplomatic relations, (a) Canada and Taiwan may enter into agreements with each other; and (b) the laws of Canada respecting international agreements between states applies to such agreements.

Salaries and Annuities Time in judicial office and salary 126 (1) For the purposes of calculating an annuity under Part I, if a full hearing panel decides that the removal from office of a judge who is the subject of a complaint is justified, the day after the day on which the hearing panel sends a notice of its decision to the judge is the judge\u2019s the last day in judicial office and the day that is to be used to determine the judge\u2019s salary unless (a) the decision is set aside by a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, or by the decision of an appeal panel if the appeal panel\u2019s decision is final; (b) the Minister\u2019s public response under subsection 140 (1) provides that no action is to be taken to remove the judge from office; or (c) the matter of removal of the judge from office is put to one or both Houses of Parliament and is rejected by either of them.
