# BIRS_CIH_dashboard
 
 
## Description
 -  Dashboard for hackthon, use flask as restful api, dash as server, and altair\plotly\D3 as visulization tool


## Installation
I recommend installing pandas, since you will most likely use them.

    $ pip install pandas
    
Then, just install Dash. Plotly comes with Dash

    $ pip install dash
    
If you'd like to control the version of Plotly installed, you can do for example:

    $ pip install plotly==4.9.0
